# Darth Maul Plugin v0.3.2

* Darth Maul mode
* One controller support
* In-game toggles
* Auto-detect functions that enables you to join/split the sabers during a map.
* Built-in unrandomizer for no arrow mode when darth maul mode on.

# Configuration

Run the game once to generate the settings, they are in Beat Saber/UserData/modprefs.ini.

```ini
[Darth Maul Plugin]
DMSerparation=15
DMDarthMode=0
DMOneHanded=0
DMAutoDetect=0
```

# Leaderboards
Turnning on Darh Maul Mode results in a separated leaderboard.

AutoDetect now only works in no-fail/party mode for this particular reason.

It's compatible with HiddenBlocks, meaning 
* DarhMaulMode on is one leaderborad.
* HiddenBlocks on is another.
* DarhMaulMode and HiddenBlocks both on yet another brand-new leaderboard.
